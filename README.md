# Bitcoin Prediction Project
Bitcoin Hackathon Project - Predicting Bitcoin close prices through Machine Learning. 

Process: Did ensemble recursive feature engineering with: Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, Random Forest, Ada Boost and Gradient Boosting.

Model: Modeled with Random Forest.

Lessons Learned: Was a really good learning experience where Thomas Inglesby and I learned a lot about modeling and Python. We worked on this over three weeks on and off and it taught us a lot about the nuances of predictive modeling. Really happy with my Recursive Feature Elimination that reduced the dimensionality from ~40 to ~20 features.
